      "At a time when the two extremes of malnourishment and obesity plague large portions of the world India has taken it upon herself to educate the masses about these smallseeded grasses that are highly beneficial to human health.Millet and grain cereals despite being rich sources of protein and antioxidants with high nutritional value have never been considered fashionable foods however India has done remarkably well when it has come to meeting the caloric needs and demands of her people.India the worlds largest producer and the worlds secondlargest exporter of millet are hoping to change the humble millets reputation worldwide.Unlike a large part of the rest of the world almost every Indian household is acquainted with the taste and the benefits of millet.Millets have been a staple of the Indian diet especially in rural India for years and remain prevalent even today. It was a remarkable achievement considering India had not even touched the export mark of USD 30 million worth of millets in 2019 and 2020.India home to 20 per cent of the global millet production with a staggering 80 per cent contribution to Asias millet production also proposed that the United Nations declare an international year of millet according to APEDA.Cognizant of Indias success in feeding her vast population and working for global welfare the global body declared 2023 as the international year of millets. While this is already a vast number of people proponents of millet production are of the opinion that a greater number of people should include millet in their diet.Millets are versatile grains that grow in half the time as wheat and use 70 per cent less water than rice providing a multifold benefit.A concentrated campaign to enhance the production and consumption of millets which are rich in carbs proteins and vitamins can change the entire paradigm of the food and health industry globally.Several experts have agreed that a sincere effort towards millet production can help countries effectively overcome micronutrient deficiencies.India already a selfsufficient country when it comes to ensuring food for its people is on a mission to capitalize on its millet market and deliver its people the benefits that go beyond just one aspect of human welfare\n",
